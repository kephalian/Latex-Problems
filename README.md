Here’s a Markdown (README.md) file you can upload to your GitHub repository to help others avoid the same LaTeX issues.

README.md # Common LaTeX Issues and Fixes When working with LaTeX, you might encounter frustrating quirks that can waste time if you don't know how to handle them. Here are two common problems and their solutions. 



## **1. References Not Showing in the Bibliography (Bibtex and Biber) and PDF not generated** 

### **Problem You compile your `.tex` file, but the bibliography appears empty, even though your `.bib` file has entries. PDF file is not generated. Same problem for both biber and bibtex, pdf is not generated. Most importantly there is no error message except some vague warning that there are no citations.** ###


### **Cause** LaTeX only includes references in the bibliography **if they are cited** in the document. If you don’t cite them, they won’t show up. ### 


**Solution** To force all references to appear, add this line before `\bibliography{}`: 

```latex \nocite{*}

% Includes all references from the .bib file, even if they are not cited

Example \documentclass{article}
\begin{document} A reference: \cite{knuth1984tex}.

\nocite{*} % Ensures all references appear in the bibliography \bibliographystyle{plain}

 \bibliography{references}

 % Make sure this matches your .bib file name

\end{document}

```
How to Compile 

Run these commands in order:
```
pdflatex myfile.tex 
bibtex myfile  (or)  biber myfile
pdflatex myfile.tex 
pdflatex myfile.tex 
```

## 2. LaTeX Gets Stuck at a ? Prompt Problem ##

## **2.While compiling or installing packagesth the LaTeX console suddenly stops and shows a ? prompt. It appears unresponsive.** ##

Cause 

LaTeX is waiting for user input. This usually happens due to:

A missing file (e.g., .bib or .sty file) A missing citation or reference A syntax error in the document Solution 

Simply press Enter to continue. If there’s a critical error, LaTeX will skip the problem and try to proceed.

Example 

If you see this:

LaTeX Warning: Citation `knuth1984tex' on page 1 undefined on input line 5. ? 
### See ? ###

### Just press Enter, and LaTeX will keep compiling.###
### It is not stuck just waiting for your input!###
Conclusion Use \nocite{*} to ensure all references appear in the bibliography. Press Enter if LaTeX stops at a ? prompt. 

By keeping these fixes in mind, you can save time and frustration while working with LaTeX.
